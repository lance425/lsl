                    <h2>I'm Lance Littlefield and I build things.</h2>

                    <p class="lead">What I build depends on the situation. I primarily build websites, but I have been known to build coffee tables, walls and even a pretty good relationship with my fiancée. If you are interested in building things get in touch with me <a href="#contact">somehow</a>. Maybe we can build something together!</p>
                    
                    <p class="lead">I'm a completely self taught developer with all of my experience coming from books, videos and articles online. I've learned quite a bit about HTML, CSS and Javascript over the past year and I can't wait to dive into server side languages like PHP and Python.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Prior to being a developer I've been a student, lineman, flooring installer, convenience store clerk, landscaper and a server. You can see from my work history I never imagined I would end up building something so abstract as websites, but here I am!</p>

                    <p class="lead">I live in Baton Rouge, LA with the aforementioned fiancée and a couple of spoiled dogs. You'll see a picture of one later!  I haven't always lived in Baton Rouge. The first twenty years of my life were spent on the fast paced streets of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downsville,_Louisiana">Downsville, LA</a>. Check it out. It's a place!</p>

      	<p>I'm a tinkerer. It is what I do. I like to figure out how and why something works. If I can't figure it out on my own then we live in a time and place that allows me to simply sit down at my desk and find the info I need.</p>

		<p>As mentioned before, I grew up in a very small town. There I learned of the necessity to fix things oneself. If I had somewhere I wanted to be and my El Camino was not running, then I had two choices. Fix it or stay home. So I learned to fix it. </p>

		<p>I did not have to teach myself though, I had numerous people in my life who helped me develop the skills I needed. Whether it was putting a new CV joint on my Carola or crawling under the house to repair a busted water pipe, I learned the skills I needed to fix these things while someone with more experience than myself watched over my shoulder. </p>

		<p>That is what we are trying to bring to the people of Baton Rouge. A place where they can come and find people to watch their backs and teach them how to run a welding machine or repair a lawn mower. </p>

		<p>I do not want to do it for you. I want you to do it for yourself.</p>

      	<p>Like most American boys, I grew up on a steady diet of baseball and football. I grew up with my Grandparents and the two of them loved sports, I assume, more than the average retired couple. </p>

		<p>My Grandfather was a former minor League baseball player and roughneck who had spent most of his life in the oil field. Before there was NFL Sunday Ticket my Grandfather would go and take all of the televisions and hook them up in the living room so he could watch all the of the televised games. It did not seem weird at the time. It was just the way it was. </p>


		<p>I started baseball at a young age and once I made it to highschool I started playing basketball as well. I was never a transcendent talent, but it did not change the fact that I enjoyed playing both sports. In Louisiana there are two divisions below Class A sports. Classes B &amp C. Both of these divisions were for schools with very small populations. My highschool was a small Class B, and because of the low attendance only had baseball and basketball as options. </p>


		<p>Between my Grandfathers love for the sport and my own love for sports video games I’ve come to enjoy and understand football (Thanks Madden!) despite never having the opportunity to play it. </p>


		<p>rowing up in north Louisiana would have put in line to be a fan of two teams, the Dallas Cowboys or the New Orleans Saints, but that is not what happened. I was born in Denver, CO on a cold December night. I lived in Denver for the four years of my life and the Broncos made it to the Super Bowl three times in the span. In fact, Denver quarterback John Elway was talked about so much around me that my first words were “Bronco Elway.” </p>


		<p>There is a very simple way to start an argument with me. Just say the phrase, “I think the designated hitter helps baseball.” I might just stab you in the neck with the shards of Sammy Sosa’s corked bat. </p>


		<p>After living in Denver, my mother and father moved to Houston. This is where I instantly became a fan of Houston Astros. I worshipped the “Killer B’s” like gods and rooted for the team even after I moved to north Louisiana in the early nineties. I continued to pull for them until March 31, 2013. That was their American League debut. </p>

   		<p>I love the written word.</p> 

   		<p>There is little I enjoy more than starting a new book and knowing I will get lost in its pages for the next few hours. I enjoy reading all types of works, but my bread and butter is science fiction and fantasy. From Tolkien’s epics to Robert A. Heinlein’s Starship Troopers, there is something about these works that just grabs me and won’t let go.  </p>

		<p>The first novel I remember reading  was The Hero and the Crown by Robin McKinley. It featured sword fighting on horseback, magic, and a protagonist who had no idea where her place in the world was. All of the necessary ingredients to ensnare a young mind and lead him down the road of literary abandon.</p> 

		<p>This course has also led me down the road of writing a little as well. I try to participate every year in National Novel Writing Month (AKA: NaNoWriMo.) A direct quote from their about page says, “National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) is a fun, seat-of-your-pants approach to creative writing,” and they couldn’t be more correct. </p>

		<p>Writing 1666.6 words a day is challenge for anyone who is not used to it, but completing it makes you feel pretty amazing. I have not finished since 2010, but I have participated every year and I will again this year!</p>
